title: Distributed Systems
description: "<p>Most software is now distributed in some sense. This course is meant to serve as an introduction to distributed systems, emphasizing techniques for creating functional, usable, and high-performance distributed systems.</p>

<p>This course aims to: (1) provide students with an understanding of the principles and techniques behind the design of distributed systems, such as locking, concurrency, scheduling, and communication across the network. (2) provide students with practical experience designing, implementing, and debugging real distributed systems.</p>

<p>Major themes covered in this course include scarcity, scheduling, concurrency and concurrent programming, naming, abstraction and modularity, imperfect communication and other types of failure, protection from accidental and malicious harm, optimism, and the use of instrumentation and monitoring and debugging tools in problem solving. As the creation and management of software systems is a fundamental goal of any undergraduate systems course, students will design, implement, and debug large programming projects.</p>"
