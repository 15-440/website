## Additional, much older midterms and finals if you want

Please note that these are from a much older version of the class. The topics covered may differ from those covered in recent years. Some of the exams ask C++ coding questions from before we introduced Go! But practice is practice and will transfer to our current exams in some ways. Also note that the final exams here were double the length of the midterms.
