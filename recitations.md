We have several recitation sessions, divided into a few formats. We have:

- **in-person** recitation sessions
- **remote** recitation sessions

**All** recitations take place EITHER on Wednesdays or Saturdays.

|    A    | Wednesday |  9:10pm - 10:00pm | In-Person |
|    B    | Wednesday |  9:10pm - 10:00pm | In-Person |

_**IMPORTANT NOTE:**_ You may NOT attend an in-person recitation that you are not registered for. This is a COVID-related university-wide regulation. Therefore, we will not be publicly posting room locations for in-person recitation sessions. If you are registered for an in-person recitation, you can view the location of your session in SIO.

## In-Person Recitation Sessions

Update: Going forward, we will send out an RSVP form to students registered for in-person sections each week.  If you might want to attend in-person, please fill out the form.  We will follow up with room info once we see how many sections we need to hold in-person.  (If you decide you want to attend in-person after the form has closed, email Matthew <maweidne@andrew.cmu.edu> and he'll send you the room info, assuming there is still space.)

If you are scheduled for an in-person recitation session, we do not require you to physically attend the session if you feel uncomfortable (or cannot) attend in  person.

All in-person recitation sessions will be livestreamed and recorded as well. So if you prefer to attend the the in-person recitation session REMOTELY, you will be able to.

Finding Zoom links to livestreamed in-person recitations:

- If your in-person recitation is on SATURDAY, you may simply use the Zoom link for the regular lectures.
- If your in-person recitation is on WEDNESDAY, the TAs will post a Zoom link as a Canvas announcement shortly before the start of the recitation.

It’s also worth noting that from the perspective of the TA managing the in-person session, it can sometimes be difficult to seamlessly field questions from in-person students and remote students equally. So if you are attending an in-person session remotely, please be patient.

Other in-person recitation session rules you should already be aware of:

- masks are required on campus both outdoors and indoors
- you must complete the CMU daily assessment before coming to campus (and clearly you should stay home if you feel at all unwell)
- you must abide by social distancing guidelines (all classrooms should be well marked)

## REMOTE-ONLY Recitation Sessions

All REMOTE-ONLY recitation sessions will take place on the Zoom link for regular lectures.

Anyone is welcome to attend any remote version of a recitation session. That is, if you wish to REMOTELY attend an in-person recitation session that you are not registered for, you may. However, it’s worth noting that from the perspective of the TA managing the in-person session, it can sometimes be difficult to seamlessly field questions from in-person students and remote students equally. So if you are attending an in-person session remotely, please be patient.
